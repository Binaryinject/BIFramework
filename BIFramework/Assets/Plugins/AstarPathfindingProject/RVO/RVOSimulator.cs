	/// Unity front end for an RVO simulator.
	/// Attached to any GameObject in a scene, scripts such as the RVOController will use the
	/// simulator exposed by this class to handle their movement.
	/// In pretty much all cases you should only have a single RVOSimulator in the scene.
	///
	/// You can have more than one of these, however most scripts which make use of the RVOSimulator
	/// will use the <see cref="active"/> property which just returns the first simulator in the scene.
	///
	/// This is only a wrapper class for a Pathfinding.RVO.Simulator which simplifies exposing it
	/// for a unity scene.
